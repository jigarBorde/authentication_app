This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
## Fullstack Next.js TypeScript TailwindCSS App with User Authentication

This is a full-stack application built using Next.js with TypeScript and TailwindCSS. The app includes user authentication features such as signup, login, email verification, and authorized middleware checking.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features
User Authentication: Includes signup, login, and email verification functionality.
Middleware Checking: Implements authorized middleware checking for protected routes.
